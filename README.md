# Python-Pandas-EDA
Exploratory data analysis on python libraries

# Background information
 
 This repository is part of my #100daysofcodingchallenge, where we are working on Exploratory Data Analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib
 
 This work is done with reference to Keith Galli youtube tutorial.
 The sales data is available in Sales_Data folder which consists of 12 months of purchase history data. The datat contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purcase address etc.
 
 As usual any data analysis starts with data cleaning. We play with Nan values, removing rows and change thetype of columns.Post data cleaning we answer the business level questions.
 
To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:

* Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
* Adding columns
* Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
* Using the .apply() method
* Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
* Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
* Labeling our graphs
